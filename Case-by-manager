Task 

Your manager has called for a quick meeting because she want you to go to the Dev Env, and check whether the jenkins server has docker and git installed, 
and if not installed, she want you to install the two binaries. The manager has advised you to create a bash script that will 
check if the docker and the git binaries exist in the jenkins server and if not the script should be able to install both. 
The manager would like to ensure that the script will run as the root. The root priviliges are vital when installing packages 
in the work servers because this can affect the compatability of the enviornment. Finally, the manager would like you to test, and 
then push the script and store it in the dev branch to allow collaboration and for future reusability. 

Point to observe. 

Docker is a service. Therefore, ensure that docker service is started and enabled. 

Solution is a bash script
